# Everybody Codes

Here you can find my solutions to [Everybody Codes](https://everybody.codes) - programming puzzles inspired by
famous [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) and created by [Emil KaczyÅ„ski](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emil-kaczy%C5%84ski-a5a05872/).
You can also check for my [Advent of Code solutions](https://github.com/mmakos/Advent-of-Code).

To keep things a little more interesting I use C++ for my solutions (instead of lame python etc.) as I won't
get into a leaderboard anyway. Even if I could make it so fast, I discovered Everybody Codes when all 2024 puzzles were 
already released.
I try to make my solutions simple and clear, without any sophisticated, language specific constructions.

C++ solutions are located in `main/cpp` directory. Code should compile with C++ 26 and CMake >= 3.27.

Every year has its own directory, and every quest its own (and only one) file (with solutions for all 3 tasks).
Inputs are stored in `input` directory - one dir per year, one dir per quest and one file per task. I don't share input
(as it is forbidden due to copyrights). In order to run a solution you have to copy your input
(**without new line at the end of file**) into `input/yearYYYY/questQQ/taskT.txt` file.

_Good luck with solving **Everybody Codes** puzzles._
